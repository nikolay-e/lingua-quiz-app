            Cleaned up **${count}** orphaned preview environments.

            ### Removed Previews

            ${dirs.map(d => {
              const pr = d.match(/pr-(\d+)/)[1];
              return `- PR #${pr} (\`${d}\`)`;
            }).join('\n')}

            ### Possible Causes

            This cleanup was needed because:
            - PR close webhooks may have failed
            - Cleanup workflow encountered errors
            - Manual PR deletion bypassed workflows

            ### Recommendations

            ${count >= 10 ? '⚠️ **High number of orphaned previews detected.**\n' +
            'Consider investigating why the cleanup workflow is failing.\n\n' : ''}

            - Monitor cleanup workflow runs
            - Check GitHub webhook delivery status
            - Review preview environment limits
